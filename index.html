            <h3>Who am I?</h3>
            <p> My full name is Muzhykou Ivan. I graduated from communications academy. 
                Currently I work for the biggest telecommunication provider in Belarus , for Beltelecom. 
                My work experience is 4 years. I work with Linux, docker, VCS, ansible, sip telephony. 
                I also work with MySQL DB and Mongo DB, but I want to improve my database knowledge.
                In addition to the above, I studied such tools as Jenkins, Kubernetes, 
                Nginx, Apache, IaaC (Terraform), Cloud provider (AWS). 
                I can identify my two main strengths : I have great soft skills and  I'm problem fixer. 
                My main project and success is automate bootstrap infrastructure our CC. 
                I used ansible for that. Now I want to work with clouds, because it's too comfortable and useful. 
                I want to build large and reliable infrastructure for important and interesting projects. 
                Thanks for your attention.
 
                I also love to study new technology and tools for my work,  
                I like to automate my work and fix our problems.</p>
